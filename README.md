### Genre Classification of Song Lyrics

**Summary**: Using 50,000 songs, I trained a DistilBERT Model with PyTorch to classify song lyrics into one of five genres: Rap, R&B, Rock, Pop, and Country.

**New Skills**:
- **MLFlow**: I used MLFlow to help me organize and log my training progress.
- **FastAPI**: I used FastAPI to build the backend API for this project.
- **Docker**: I containerized the backend for production.
- **Azure Web Services**: I used Azure to host the API.

**Points of Pride**:
- **`pytorch_trainer.py`, `dataset_loader.py`**: These scripts greatly improve upon the PyTorch training I used for my Master's Thesis.
